Our projects integrates local vendors to create a reliable network for local community of a particular city.
Our aim is to make the entire process of taking a business online, simpler for the local sellers. The flexible backend allows the site to form various clusters based on location, seller, product range etc. 
We focus on personalization of a seller's online shop. To avoid getting lost in the crowd, our objective is to maintain the relationship between the seller and the buyer amidst the pandemic. The seller can expand at his own comfort, while the buyer is displayed the seller based on his location. The buyer can either opt for a delivery service or a drive through to keep up the pre-ordered items to maintain social distancing. 
Our website is an easy to use for both the seller and the buyer. Navigation, search, flexible back-end, progressive web app, responsiveness and most importantly the simplicity of the website is what makes us unique. After the campaign is over, we plan to integrate the up-coming features and implement it for a particular town to drive in the traffic through digital marketing and make it the first E-town in India.
